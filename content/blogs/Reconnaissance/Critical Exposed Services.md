# Critical Exposed Services and Their Default Authentication States

Most security teams monitor for common ports like 22 (SSH) or 53 (DNS), but attackers often look for **quietly critical services**‚Äîthose that offer deep access into infrastructure but often lack authentication by default.

This guide outlines **commonly exposed services**, the ports they typically run on, whether they are **authenticated by default**, and the potential **impact if left open**.

---

## Why Focus on These Services?

These aren't your average TCP listeners‚Äîthey are:

* **Backbones of modern infrastructure** (containers, metrics, queues)
* Often misconfigured in cloud-native and DevOps setups
* Usually lack traditional perimeter protections
* Capable of **remote code execution**, **privilege escalation**, or **sensitive data exposure**

## Table: Critical Services, Ports, and Authentication Defaults

| Service                   | Common Ports             | Authenticated by Default?  | Risk if Exposed                         |

| **Zookeeper**             | 2181                     | ‚ùå No                       | Topic hijack, metadata exposure         |
| **Elasticsearch**         | 9200, 9300               | ‚ùå No                       | Full index read/write access            |
| **Jupyter Notebook**      | 8888                     | ‚ö†Ô∏è Often no (token in URL) | Code execution, data exfiltration       |

## Visual Summary

| Auth State          | # of Services |
| ------------------- | ------------- |
| ‚ùå No Auth           | 10            |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Varies           | 3             |
| ‚úÖ Secure by Default | 1             |

More than **75% of these services are unauthenticated by default**.

## How Attackers Exploit These

When attackers scan the internet or a CIDR block, they **don‚Äôt care about SSH**‚Äîthey look for services like:

* **Redis with no password** ‚Üí Load malware into memory, fileless persistence
* **Kubernetes with anonymous access** ‚Üí Launch pods, pivot inside cloud infra
* **Docker on 2375** ‚Üí Mount host file system, run containers as root
* **Etcd exposed** ‚Üí Grab Kubernetes secrets, creds, and TLS certs

These services don‚Äôt always raise alarms but **quietly hand over control** of your infrastructure.

---

## Example Misconfiguration: Open Redis

```bash
# Connect directly if port is exposed
redis-cli -h <IP> -p 6379

# No password prompt? You‚Äôre in.
127.0.0.1:6379> CONFIG GET *
```

In such a scenario, attackers can set up cron jobs, store payloads, and execute system commands‚Äî**no exploits needed**.

## Best Practices

| Action                     | Description                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Enable Auth Everywhere  | Use TLS, passwords, and access control lists         |
| Monitor for Open Ports  | Use tools like Cert-X-Gen or ZMap for exposure intel |
| Block on Firewalls     | Block internal services from external networks       |
| Disable Unused Services | Shut down dashboards, dev ports, and test APIs       |
| Inventory Regularly     | Build and update a port ‚Üí service ‚Üí auth map         |

## Conclusion

Modern infrastructure stacks introduce powerful services‚Äîbut also **powerful risks** if left unauthenticated. This blog maps out the most **critical misconfigurations** we see in the wild.

Before attackers get in, ask yourself:

* Have you scanned your cloud for these ports?
* Are they password-protected, or wide open?
* Can you map these exposures to cloud regions and providers?

If not‚Äînow‚Äôs the time to start.

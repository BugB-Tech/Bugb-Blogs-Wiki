# Linux Kernel Netfilter Use-After-Free: CVE-2024-1086 Actively Exploited in the Wild

## Summary

**CVE-2024-1086** is a **use-after-free vulnerability** in the Linux kernel’s **netfilter (nf_tables)** subsystem. The flaw has been **confirmed as actively exploited in the wild**, allowing **local attackers to escalate privileges to root** on affected systems. Exploitation has been observed across multiple distributions, making this a high-priority patching item for Linux environments.

## Affected Products & Fixed Releases

| Product | CVE | Severity / CVSS | Fixed In |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Linux Kernel (nf_tables) | CVE-2024-1086 | High (CVSS ~7.8) | Vendor kernel updates |

> Impact varies by distribution and kernel version. Systems running unpatched kernels with user namespaces enabled are at elevated risk.

## What Are These CVEs?

- **CVE-2024-1086 — Use-After-Free (UAF)**
  - A memory management flaw in nf_tables.
  - Allows local users to manipulate freed kernel objects.
  - Can result in **privilege escalation to root**.
  - Added to **CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)** catalog.

## Attack Chain / Exploitation Overview

Observed exploitation follows a typical local privilege escalation pattern:

1. **Initial Access**
   - Attacker gains local code execution (low-privileged user, container escape precondition, or compromised service).
2. **Kernel Trigger**
   - Malformed netfilter rules exploit the use-after-free condition.
3. **Memory Corruption**
   - Freed kernel objects are reused in a controlled manner.
4. **Privilege Escalation**
   - Attacker executes code with kernel privileges, gaining root access.

This vulnerability is frequently chained after initial footholds gained via phishing, exposed services, or container breakouts.

## Public PoCs & Research References

Public proof-of-concept code **is available**, significantly lowering the barrier to exploitation.

- GitHub repositories demonstrating local privilege escalation via nf_tables  
  https://github.com/search?q=CVE-2024-1086
- Security researcher analyses detailing exploit reliability and affected kernels
- CISA KEV entry confirming active exploitation

PoCs are widely used for **post-compromise privilege escalation** and are commonly integrated into automated attack toolchains.

## Non-Exploit Validation Playbook

### 1) Identify Kernel Version
- Check kernel version: `uname -r`
- Map against vendor advisories and patched builds.

### 2) Assess Exposure Conditions
- User namespaces enabled
- Unprivileged local users or containers present
- netfilter / nftables in use

### 3) Hunt for Indicators
- Unusual `nft` or `iptables` rule manipulations
- Kernel crashes or OOPS related to nf_tables
- Unexpected root-level processes spawned from user contexts

### 4) Containment
- Restrict local access on shared systems.
- Harden container runtime configurations.

## Rapid Hardening Checklist

- Apply kernel updates from your distribution immediately.
- Reboot systems after patching to ensure fixes take effect.
- Restrict unprivileged user namespaces where feasible.
- Monitor for abnormal nftables activity.
- Treat unpatched systems as **assumed vulnerable**.

## Why This Matters

Linux local privilege escalation flaws like CVE-2024-1086 are **force multipliers**. Once attackers gain any form of access, these bugs enable full system takeover, bypassing traditional security controls and undermining container isolation.

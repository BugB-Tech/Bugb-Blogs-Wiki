# Critical Apache OFBiz RCE: CVE-2026-0103 Actively Exploited in the Wild

## Summary

A newly disclosed **critical remote code execution vulnerability** in **Apache OFBiz**, tracked as **CVE-2026-0103**, is being **actively exploited in the wild**. The flaw allows **unauthenticated attackers** to execute arbitrary code by abusing OFBiz’s XML-RPC request handling. Security researchers have observed **public proof-of-concept exploits**, rapid scanning activity, and early-stage cryptominer deployment following compromise.

Apache has released fixes, and CISA has added the vulnerability to the **Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)** catalog, urging immediate remediation.

## Affected Products & Fixed Releases

| Product            | Vulnerable Versions | Fixed Version        | Notes |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Apache OFBiz**   | ≤ 18.12.13          | **18.12.14**         | Patch required immediately |
| **Managed OFBiz deployments** | Varies | Vendor-dependent | Check downstream patches |

> Internet-facing OFBiz instances are at highest risk, especially those used for ERP and order management.

## What Is CVE-2026-0103?

- **CVE-2026-0103 — Remote Code Execution**
  - **CVSS v3.1:** 9.8 (Critical)
  - **Attack Vector:** Network
  - **Authentication:** None required
  - **Root Cause:** Improper validation of serialized XML-RPC requests
  - **Exploitation Status:** Actively exploited in the wild

According to NVD and CISA, exploitation does not require prior access and can lead to full system compromise.

## Attack Chain / Exploitation Overview

Observed attack patterns follow a simple but effective flow:

1. **Discovery**
   - Mass scanning for `/webtools/control/xmlrpc` endpoints
2. **Initial Exploit**
   - Malicious XML-RPC payload triggers command execution
3. **Payload Delivery**
   - Bash or PowerShell stagers fetched from attacker-controlled servers
4. **Post-Exploitation**
   - Cryptominers
   - Credential harvesting
   - Lateral movement in ERP-connected networks

Several incidents show attackers pivoting from OFBiz into **internal databases and finance systems**, amplifying impact.

## Public PoCs & Research References

The following **public PoCs and research references exist**. They are linked for awareness only.

- GitHub PoC demonstrating unauthenticated RCE via XML-RPC
  - Shows command execution capability
  - Does **not** include weaponized payloads
- Security researcher writeups confirming exploit reliability
- Shodan data indicating thousands of exposed OFBiz instances globally

> The availability of public PoCs significantly lowers the barrier to exploitation and increases automated attack risk.

## Non-Exploit Validation Playbook

Use the following **safe validation steps** to assess exposure:

### 1. Identify OFBiz Instances
- Inventory ERP and backend services
- Search internally for:
  - `OFBiz`
  - `/webtools/control/`

### 2. Verify Version
- Check `framework/base/config/ofbiz-containers.xml`
- Confirm version is **18.12.14 or later**

### 3. Log Review
Hunt for:
- Requests to `/xmlrpc`
- Unusual POST bodies with serialized XML
- Process spawning from OFBiz Java processes

### 4. EDR Signals
- Java spawning `bash`, `sh`, or `cmd.exe`
- Unexpected outbound connections from ERP servers

## Rapid Hardening Checklist

- Patch Apache OFBiz to **18.12.14 immediately**
- Restrict or block public access to XML-RPC endpoints
- Rotate credentials stored or accessed by OFBiz
- Monitor for outbound connections from OFBiz servers
- Add WAF rules to block suspicious XML-RPC payloads
- Assume compromise if exploitation indicators are present

## Why This Matters

Apache OFBiz is commonly deployed in **financial, retail, and logistics environments**. Successful exploitation can expose:

- Customer PII
- Payment workflows
- Internal ERP credentials

The combination of **unauthenticated access**, **public PoCs**, and **active exploitation** makes this a high-priority remediation item for security teams.

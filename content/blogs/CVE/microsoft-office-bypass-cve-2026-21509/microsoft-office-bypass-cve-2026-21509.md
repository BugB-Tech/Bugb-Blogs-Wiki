3. **Security Bypass**
   - The crafted file triggers the security feature bypass when opened. [1][2]

## Public PoCs & Research References

No public proof-of-concept is referenced in official advisory sources at this time. [1][2]

## Non-Exploit Validation Playbook

Use the following **safe validation steps** to assess exposure:

### 1. Identify Office Installations
- Inventory Office 2016/2019, Office LTSC 2021/2024, and Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise. [1][2]

### 2. Verify Patch Status
- Ensure the latest Microsoft security updates are applied for each affected product. [1][2]

### 3. Prioritize KEV Coverage
- Treat vulnerable Office installations as urgent because the CVE is in CISA KEV. [1]

## Rapid Hardening Checklist

- Apply Microsoft security updates for all affected Office versions immediately. [1][2]
- Follow MSRC guidance for any additional mitigations required by your environment. [1]
- Track remediation status for Office assets in scope of the KEV listing. [1]

## Why This Matters

A security feature bypass that requires only a user opening a document is high risk, especially with confirmed exploitation. [1][2]

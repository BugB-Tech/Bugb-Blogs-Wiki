## What Is CVE-2025-55182?

- **CVE-2025-55182 - Unauthenticated RCE via React Server Components**
  - **CVSS v3.1:** 10.0 (Critical)
  - **Attack Vector:** Network
  - **Authentication:** None required
  - **Root Cause:** Crafted HTTP requests to server function endpoints can lead to code execution
  - **Exploitation Status:** Active exploitation reported

## Attack Chain / Exploitation Overview

1. **Discovery** of an internet-exposed application using React Server Components.
2. **Crafted HTTP request** to a server function endpoint.
3. **Server-side code execution** on the affected host.

## Public PoCs & Research References

- Public PoC activity has been reported by the original researcher; review for awareness only.

## Non-Exploit Validation Playbook

### 1. Identify React Server Components Usage
- Inventory apps using React Server Components or server functions.

### 2. Check React Package Versions
- Validate if React packages are on **19.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.2.0** and upgrade to fixed releases.

### 3. Check Next.js Versions
- If you run Next.js, upgrade to the fixed versions listed in the Next.js advisory.

## Rapid Hardening Checklist

- Upgrade React RSC packages to **19.0.1**, **19.1.2**, or **19.2.1** as appropriate.
- Upgrade Next.js to the fixed branches (**15.0.5**, **14.2.18**, **13.5.10**, **12.3.5**).
- If you were exposed and unpatched, rotate secrets and review for compromise per Next.js guidance.
- Do not rely on hosting provider mitigations as a replacement for patching.

## Why This Matters

Active exploitation has been reported, and the vulnerability enables unauthenticated remote code execution in server-side React applications. If your app exposes server function endpoints, this is a high-priority patch.

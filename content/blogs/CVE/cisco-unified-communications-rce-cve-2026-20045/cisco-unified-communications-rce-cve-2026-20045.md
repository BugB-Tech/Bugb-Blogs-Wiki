# Cisco Unified Communications RCE: CVE-2026-20045 Actively Exploited in the Wild

## Summary

Cisco has disclosed **CVE-2026-20045**, a **critical remote code execution (RCE)** vulnerability affecting multiple **Cisco Unified Communications** products, including Unified CM, Unified CM SME, IM & Presence, Unity Connection, and Webex Calling Dedicated Instance. The flaw is **exploitable via the web-based management interface** and requires no authentication. Cisco PSIRT reports **attempted exploitation in the wild**, and regional advisory centers have echoed active exploitation concerns. Immediate patching is recommended. [1][2]

## Affected Products & Fixed Releases

| Product | Vulnerable Versions | Fixed Release | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Unified CM / Unified CM SME / IM & Presence / Webex Calling DI (UCM)** | **12.5, 14, 15** | **12.5**: migrate to a fixed release; **14**: 14SU5 or apply a Cisco patch; **15**: 15SU4 (Mar 2026) or apply a Cisco patch | No workaround; patching required [1] |
| **Unity Connection** | **12.5, 14, 15** | **12.5**: migrate to a fixed release; **14**: 14SU5 or apply a Cisco patch; **15**: 15SU4 (Mar 2026) or apply a Cisco patch | Patch guidance is version-specific [1] |

> If you run 12.5, 14, or 15 in production, prioritize upgrade planning and request interim patches from Cisco TAC where applicable. [1]

## What Is CVE-2026-20045?

- **CVE-2026-20045 — Remote Code Execution**
  - **CVSS v3.1:** 8.2 (High)
  - **Attack Vector:** Network
  - **Privileges Required:** None
  - **User Interaction:** None
  - **Root Cause:** Improper input validation in the web-based management interface
  - **Exploitation Status:** Attempted exploitation observed in the wild [1][3]

Cisco states that successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on affected systems and potentially escalate to root. [1]

## Attack Chain / Exploitation Overview

Typical management-plane RCE attack flows follow this pattern:

1. **Discovery**
   - Identify internet-facing Unified CM or Unity Connection management interfaces [1]
2. **Initial Exploit**
   - Crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface to trigger code execution [1]
3. **Post-Exploitation**
   - Deploy follow-on tooling, establish persistence, or pivot to internal voice infrastructure

> While exploitation details are not publicly disclosed, the presence of in-the-wild attempts indicates elevated risk for exposed interfaces. [1][2]

## Public PoCs & Research References

Cisco’s advisory does **not reference a public proof-of-concept** at this time. Treat the vulnerability as high risk regardless, given confirmed exploitation attempts. [1]

## Non-Exploit Validation Playbook

Use the following **safe validation steps** to assess exposure:

### 1. Identify Unified Communications Management Interfaces
- Inventory Unified CM, IM & Presence, and Unity Connection instances
- Confirm which systems expose the **web-based management interface** to untrusted networks [1]

### 2. Verify Version
- Confirm if the platform is running **12.5, 14, or 15**
- Map to the fixed release guidance above or request a TAC patch [1]

### 3. Log Review
Hunt for:
- Unusual HTTP requests to management endpoints
- Spikes in failed auth attempts or low-privilege logins

### 4. EDR / Endpoint Signals
- Unexpected process execution on appliance hosts
- Outbound connections from Unified Communications servers to untrusted IPs

## Rapid Hardening Checklist

- Apply fixed releases or interim patches per Cisco guidance **immediately** [1]
- Restrict or fully block external access to the management interface [1]
- Limit administrative access to trusted networks and MFA-protected bastions
- Monitor for anomalous HTTP access patterns against management endpoints [1]
- Assume compromise if indicators of exploitation are present

## Why This Matters

Unified Communications platforms often sit on the **core voice infrastructure** of enterprises and government agencies. A successful RCE can lead to:

- Unauthorized access to call control and VoIP signaling
- Lateral movement into internal networks
- Disruption of business-critical communications

Given the exploitation reports and management-plane exposure, this vulnerability demands immediate attention. [1][2]

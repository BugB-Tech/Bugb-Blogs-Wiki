# Vite Dev Server File Read: CVE-2025-31125 Added to CISA KEV

## Summary

**CVE-2025-31125** is an **improper access control** issue in the **Vite dev server** that can allow **unauthorized file reads** when the dev server is **exposed to the network** (for example via `--host` or `server.host`). CISA has added it to the **Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)** catalog, emphasizing the need to immediately restrict dev servers and upgrade to fixed releases. citeturn3search0turn3search2

## What Is CVE-2025-31125?

- **CVE-2025-31125 - Improper Access Control -> Unauthorized File Read**
  - **CVSS v3.1:** 8.8 (High)
  - **Attack Vector:** Network
  - **Authentication:** None required
  - **Root Cause:** Dev server request handling allows access to non-allowed files when the server is exposed
  - **Exploitation Status:** KEV-listed

## Attack Chain / Exploitation Overview

1. **Discovery** of a Vite dev server exposed to the internet.
2. **Crafted requests** to dev server endpoints to retrieve non-allowed files.
3. **Data exposure** from local project or environment files, depending on server configuration.

## Non-Exploit Validation Playbook

### 1. Identify Dev Servers
- Inventory Vite dev servers across CI, staging, and developer workstations.
- Flag any instances exposed outside localhost.

### 2. Verify Configuration
- Check for usage of `--host` or `server.host` that binds to non-local interfaces. citeturn3search0turn3search2

### 3. Verify Versions
- Confirm versions are upgraded to fixed releases for your branch. citeturn3search2

### 4. Log Review
Hunt for:
- Unexpected external requests to dev server endpoints
- Query patterns consistent with file retrieval attempts

## Rapid Hardening Checklist

- **Upgrade Vite** to a fixed version for your branch.
- **Bind dev servers to localhost only** unless explicitly required.
- **Restrict network access** to dev environments with firewall rules or VPN-only access.
- Monitor for unexpected external traffic to dev server ports.

## Why This Matters

Dev servers often run on developer workstations or staging environments where sensitive source code, secrets, or configuration files are nearby. Exposed dev servers can turn a low-friction developer convenience into a rapid data exposure risk. citeturn3search0turn3search2

# Breaking Sessions: The Story of CVE-2024-50562 in Fortinet Web Client

In the landscape of VPN-based remote access, session management is the gatekeeper of security. In early 2025, during a red team assessment for a client, our AI-backed offensive security framework, **Cert-X-Gen**, uncovered a critical zero-day vulnerability in the Fortinet Web Client. This flaw allowed previously expired session cookies to be reused, bypassing authentication—a textbook case of broken session invalidation.

## What is CVE-2024-50562?

CVE-2024-50562 is a critical vulnerability affecting Fortinet’s web-based VPN client (FortiOS v7.2.8 build 1639), where session tokens remain valid even after logout or natural expiration. This allows an attacker to reuse stale session data and hijack authenticated user sessions without credentials.

### CVSS Severity: 9.4 (Critical)

### Affected Versions:
- FortiOS 7.2.8 and prior
- Patched in 7.6.1 and 7.4.6 and above (pending GA release)

## Discovery Context

While assessing Scribetech’s perimeter defenses, our AI agent flagged irregular session lifecycle behavior during Fortinet Web Client interaction. The recon module from **Cert-X-Gen** validated:

- Session cookies remained active after logout  
- Replay of old session tokens allowed access to authenticated areas  
- No server-side validation for expired or revoked tokens

This behavior triggered further investigation and led to a successful reproduction of a full session hijack.

## Attack Flow Breakdown

Here’s how an attacker could exploit this:

1. **Intercept a Valid Session Cookie:** Using a tool like BurpSuite  
2. **Let the User Logout or Session Expire Naturally**  
3. **Replay the Old Cookie:** Reuse the same token in a new request  
4. **Access Restored:** Full user access resumes without credentials  

## Proof of Concept (Simplified)

```http
POST /remote/logincheck HTTP/1.1
Host: <fortinet-web-client>
Cookie: SVPNCOOKIE=<stale_token>
````

If the token was valid once, it would still work post-logout. No 401 errors. No invalidation. No questions asked.

## YAML Detection Template

To assist blue teams and researchers, here’s a structured YAML template for detecting CVE-2024-50562:

## Role of Cert-X-Gen

What made this discovery possible wasn’t luck. Our AI agent didn’t scan blindly—it:

* Fingerprinted Fortinet via behavioral cues
* Emulated realistic login/logout flows
* Replayed cookies in different timing conditions
* Flagged inconsistencies in session state

It’s not just detection—it’s intelligent adversarial simulation.

## Timeline

* **March 2025:** Vulnerability discovered during Scribetech’s engagement
* **April 2025:** PoC validated and reported to Fortinet PSIRT
* **May 2025:** Fortinet confirmed vulnerability and assigned CVE-2024-50562
* **June 10, 2025:** Advisory pending GA patch publication

We kept Scribetech informed with timely updates throughout the process and continue to monitor the PSIRT team’s advisory page.

## Recommended Fixes

* Invalidate all session tokens immediately after logout
* Implement strict expiration checks server-side
* Rotate tokens with each login and action
* Enforce anomaly detection on reused tokens

## Conclusion

CVE-2024-50562 is a reminder that session management must be airtight—especially for remote access infrastructure. With attackers growing more sophisticated, your defenses must do more than detect. They must think.

**Cert-X-Gen** gives our red teams that edge. This isn’t scanning. This is AI-led exploitation—and prevention. If you're running Fortinet infrastructure, patch immediately. And if you’re not testing your sessions, someone else might be.

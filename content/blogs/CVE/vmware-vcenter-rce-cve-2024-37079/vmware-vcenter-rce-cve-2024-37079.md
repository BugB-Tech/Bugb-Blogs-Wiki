# VMware vCenter RCE: CVE-2024-37079 Exploited in the Wild

## Summary

Apply VMware’s fixed releases for vCenter Server immediately. Broadcom has updated VMSA-2024-0012 with information indicating **in-the-wild exploitation** of CVE-2024-37079. [1]

CVE-2024-37079 is a **critical heap-overflow vulnerability** in the vCenter Server **DCERPC protocol implementation** that can be triggered by a specially crafted network packet to enable **remote code execution**. [1]

## Affected Products & Fixed Releases

| Product | Vulnerable Versions | Fixed Release | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **VMware vCenter Server** | **7.0 / 8.0** | **7.0 U3r**, **8.0 U2d**, **8.0 U1e** | Apply the fixed versions listed in the VMSA response matrix. [1] |
| **VMware Cloud Foundation (vCenter Server)** | **4.x / 5.x** | **Apply KB 88287 and fixed vCenter versions** | Broadcom provides Cloud Foundation guidance tied to vCenter fixes. [1] |

## What Is CVE-2024-37079?

- **CVE-2024-37079 — Remote Code Execution**
  - **CVSS v3.1:** 9.8 (Critical) [1]
  - **Attack Vector:** Network [1]
  - **Privileges Required:** None [1]
  - **User Interaction:** None [1]
  - **Root Cause:** Heap-overflow in the DCERPC protocol implementation [1]
  - **Exploitation Status:** In-the-wild exploitation reported by Broadcom [1]

Broadcom notes that a malicious actor with network access can send a crafted packet that may lead to remote code execution on vCenter Server. [1]

## Attack Chain / Exploitation Overview

A typical exploitation flow includes:

1. **Discovery**
   - Identify vCenter Server endpoints. [1]
2. **Initial Exploit**
   - Send a crafted DCERPC network packet to trigger the heap overflow. [1]
3. **Post-Exploitation**
   - Execute code on the vCenter server. [1]

## Public PoCs & Research References

No public proof-of-concept is referenced in the VMSA advisory. Use vendor guidance for defensive actions only. [1]

## Non-Exploit Validation Playbook

Use the following **safe validation steps** to assess exposure:

### 1. Identify vCenter and Cloud Foundation Deployments
- Inventory vCenter Server and Cloud Foundation instances. [1]

### 2. Verify Version
- Confirm whether vCenter is running **7.0 or 8.0** without the fixed updates. [1]

### 3. Confirm Remediation
- Apply the fixed versions in the VMSA response matrix (7.0 U3r, 8.0 U2d, 8.0 U1e). [1]

## Rapid Hardening Checklist

- Patch vCenter Server to the fixed versions listed by Broadcom. [1]
- Follow Cloud Foundation guidance (KB 88287) where applicable. [1]
- Prioritize remediation due to confirmed exploitation. [1]

## Why This Matters

A network-accessible RCE with confirmed exploitation can lead to full compromise of vCenter Server. [1]

# SmarterMail RCE: CVE-2025-52691 Actively Exploited

## Summary

Upgrade SmarterMail immediately. CVE-2025-52691 is a **critical unauthenticated RCE** in SmarterMail and is listed in CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, indicating active exploitation. [1][2]

The flaw affects **SmarterMail 16.x and 17.x** up to **build 9406** and is fixed in **build 9413**, which SmarterTools notes contains critical security fixes. [2][3]

## Affected Products & Fixed Releases

| Product | Vulnerable Versions | Fixed Release | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SmarterMail** | **16.x / 17.x up to build 9406** | **Build 9413** | Update to 9413 or later to remediate the unauthenticated upload RCE. [2][3] |

## What Is CVE-2025-52691?

- **CVE-2025-52691 — Remote Code Execution**
  - **CVSS v3.1:** 10.0 (Critical) [2]
  - **Attack Vector:** Network [1]
  - **Privileges Required:** None [1][2]
  - **User Interaction:** None [1]
  - **Root Cause:** Unrestricted upload leading to remote code execution in SmarterMail. [1][2]
  - **Exploitation Status:** Listed in CISA KEV (active exploitation) [1]

NVD describes the issue as an unrestricted upload allowing remote code execution. [1]

## Attack Chain / Exploitation Overview

A typical exploitation flow includes:

1. **Discovery**
   - Identify SmarterMail instances within your environment. [2]
2. **Initial Exploit**
   - Abuse the vulnerable upload path to execute code without authentication. [1][2]
3. **Post-Exploitation**
   - Execute code on the SmarterMail server. [1][2]

## Public PoCs & Research References

Public research and detection artifacts exist, including a watchTowr Labs repository referenced by NVD. Do not use these in production; treat them as awareness resources only. [1][4]

## Non-Exploit Validation Playbook

Use the following **safe validation steps** to assess exposure:

### 1. Identify SmarterMail Instances
- Inventory SmarterMail 16.x and 17.x deployments. [2]

### 2. Verify Build
- Confirm whether the system is at or below **build 9406**. [2]

### 3. Confirm Remediation
- Upgrade to **build 9413** or later per SmarterTools guidance. [2][3]

## Rapid Hardening Checklist

- Patch SmarterMail to **build 9413 or later** immediately. [2][3]
- Track remediation for SmarterMail servers due to KEV status. [1][2]
- Validate that critical security fixes from SmarterTools release notes are applied. [3]

## Why This Matters

An unauthenticated RCE with confirmed exploitation presents immediate risk and should be remediated quickly. [1][2]

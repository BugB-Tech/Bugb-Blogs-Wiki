# SmarterMail Auth Bypass: CVE-2026-23760 (WT-2026-0001)

## Summary

Update SmarterMail immediately. CVE-2026-23760 is a **critical authentication bypass** in SmarterMail that allows attackers to reset admin credentials and gain elevated access. [1][2]

NVD reports that **SmarterMail versions prior to build 9511** are affected. SmarterTools’ January 2026 release notes indicate critical security fixes in **build 9511** and later builds (including **9518**). [1][3]

## Affected Products & Fixed Releases

| Product | Vulnerable Versions | Fixed Release | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SmarterMail** | **Versions prior to build 9511** | **Build 9511+ (latest build recommended)** | SmarterTools release notes mark 9511 and 9518 as critical security fixes. [1][3] |

## What Is CVE-2026-23760?

- **CVE-2026-23760 — Authentication Bypass**
  - **CVSS v3.1:** 9.8 (Critical) [1]
  - **Attack Vector:** Network [1]
  - **Privileges Required:** None [1]
  - **User Interaction:** None [1]
  - **Root Cause:** Password reset logic allows an attacker to reset the admin password and execute administrative actions. [1][2]

NVD summarizes the flaw as a password-reset bypass that can result in code execution as SYSTEM. [1]

## Attack Chain / Exploitation Overview

A typical exploitation flow includes:

1. **Discovery**
   - Identify SmarterMail management interfaces. [2]
2. **Auth Bypass**
   - Abuse the password reset logic to take over an admin account. [1][2]
3. **Privilege Abuse**
   - Execute administrative actions or code as SYSTEM. [1]

## Public PoCs & Research References

A detailed researcher write-up is available from watchTowr Labs. Use it for defensive awareness only; do not run exploit code in production. [2]

## Non-Exploit Validation Playbook

Use the following **safe validation steps** to assess exposure:

### 1. Identify SmarterMail Instances
- Inventory SmarterMail deployments and management endpoints. [1][2]

### 2. Verify Build
- Confirm whether the instance is **prior to build 9511**. [1]

### 3. Confirm Remediation
- Upgrade to **build 9511 or later** (latest build recommended). [1][3]

## Rapid Hardening Checklist

- Patch SmarterMail to **build 9511+** as an urgent priority. [1][3]
- Prioritize remediation because the issue enables admin takeover. [1][2]
- Track remediation using SmarterTools release notes and vendor guidance. [3]

## Why This Matters

An auth bypass that enables admin takeover can lead to full server compromise and access to sensitive mail data. [1][2]

## Timeline

- **Jan 15, 2026** — SmarterTools release notes mark build 9511 as critical security fixes. [3]
- **Jan 22, 2026** — Researcher write-up published (WT-2026-0001). [2]

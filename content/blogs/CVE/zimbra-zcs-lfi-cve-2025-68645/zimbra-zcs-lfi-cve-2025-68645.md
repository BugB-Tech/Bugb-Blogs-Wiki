## Non-Exploit Validation Playbook

### 1. Identify ZCS Instances
- Inventory ZCS servers and note exposed webmail endpoints.

### 2. Verify Versions
- Confirm whether servers run **10.0.18 / 10.1.13** or later.

### 3. Log Review
Hunt for:
- Unusual unauthenticated requests to `/h/rest` endpoints
- Repeated access patterns to files within WebRoot

### 4. EDR/Network Signals
- Unexpected outbound connections from mail servers
- Anomalous file access spikes in web application directories

## Rapid Hardening Checklist

- Upgrade to **ZCS 10.0.18 or 10.1.13** immediately.
- Restrict public exposure of administrative interfaces.
- Monitor web access logs for suspicious RestFilter usage.
- Rotate credentials if indicators of compromise are detected.

## Why This Matters

ZCS is commonly deployed as a mission-critical email and collaboration platform. An unauthenticated LFI flaw on an internet-facing server can expose sensitive configuration data, user information, and pave the way for follow-on compromise. citeturn5view1

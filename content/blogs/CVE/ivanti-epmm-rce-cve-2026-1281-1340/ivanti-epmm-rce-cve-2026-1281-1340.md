# Ivanti EPMM Dual RCE: CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340 Actively Exploited

## Summary

Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) is impacted by **two critical unauthenticated code-injection vulnerabilities**, **CVE-2026-1281** and **CVE-2026-1340**, that enable **remote code execution**. Government advisories report **active exploitation in the wild**, and CISA has added the issues to the **Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)** catalog. Apply Ivanti's hotfixes or upgrade to **EPMM 12.8.0.0** immediately. citeturn4search0turn4search4turn4search5

## Attack Chain / Exploitation Overview

Observed exploitation flows are consistent with other public-facing management platform attacks:

1. **Discovery** of internet-exposed EPMM instances.
2. **Unauthenticated code-injection** to execute attacker-controlled commands.
3. **Post-exploitation** activity such as credential access, lateral movement, or persistence.

Active exploitation has been confirmed by government advisories, so internet-facing EPMM servers should be treated as high-risk. citeturn4search0turn4search4turn4search5

## Non-Exploit Validation Playbook

### 1. Identify EPMM Instances
- Inventory all EPMM deployments (on-prem and hosted).
- Flag any systems exposed to the internet.

### 2. Verify Versions and Hotfix Status
- Confirm if the instance is on 12.8.0.0 or has the correct RPM hotfix applied.
- Remember that the hotfix **does not survive upgrades**. citeturn4search0

### 3. Log Review
Hunt for:
- Unusual unauthenticated requests to EPMM management endpoints
- New processes or command execution from the EPMM service account

### 4. EDR/Network Signals
- Service processes spawning shells or system utilities
- Unexpected outbound connections from EPMM servers

## Rapid Hardening Checklist

- Apply the **RPM hotfix** for your branch or **upgrade to 12.8.0.0**.
- Restrict EPMM admin interfaces to trusted IPs or VPN-only access.
- Enforce MFA for administrative access.
- Monitor for suspicious post-exploitation activity.

## Why This Matters

EPMM manages mobile devices, credentials, and security policies across enterprise fleets. A successful unauthenticated RCE can expose device enrollment tokens, VPN profiles, and enterprise credentials - turning MDM into a high-impact entry point for attackers. citeturn4search0turn4search4turn4search5
